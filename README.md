# Library mangement system
This project uses the skills learnt from week 1 to week 6. This project aims to develop a real-time library management system in python gui When the application is started, it displays a menu as follows:

Main Menu
Enter Choice:

Admin and user window exit


If item admin is selected from the window. the window opens is show the three buttons to enter the no of book names, authors, and quantities next create a database in my SQL then enter the book name, author, and quantity it will find from the library. it gives output in table form


If you want to be recognized as a professional programmer, you have to practice more and develop applications in Python which you can include in your online portfolio. To achieve this, one such comprehensive project (with two small sub-projects inside it) is added which have to be completed by every student.
