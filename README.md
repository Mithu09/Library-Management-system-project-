# Library mangement system
This project uses the skills learnt from week 1 to week 6. This project aims to develop a real-time library management system in python gui When the application is started, it displays a menu as follows:

Main Menu

Admin and user window exit

If item admin is selected:
window opens showing 3 buttons to enter book names, authors, and quantities
create a database in MySQL
enter book name, author, and quantity and it will find from the library and give output in table form

If you want to be recognized as a professional programmer, you have to practice more and develop applications in Python which you can include in your online portfolio. To achieve this, one such comprehensive project (with two small sub-projects inside it) is added which have to be completed by every student.
